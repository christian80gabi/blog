Hey there,

After a year on Linux (OpenSUSE Tumbleweed) as my main OS. I learned that switching OS need a lot to take in consideration.  While I loved the experience,  a crucial factor ultimately brought me back to Windows 11: hardware compatibility. 

In my [last post](https://christian80gabi.github.io/blog/blog/linux/english/my-year-with-linux/), I mentioned taking hardware compatibility more seriously.  Today, I'm sharing some resources to help you check compatibility before buying a new laptop for Linux. 

**Learning from Experience: Why Compatibility Matters**

Let's face it, there's nothing more frustrating than getting a new device only to discover it doesn't work seamlessly with your chosen OS.  In my case, some hardware components just weren't as compatible as I'd hoped. 

**Finding the Perfect Match: Resources for Checking Compatibility**

To avoid this compatibility headache, here are some resources to check before your next Linux purchase:

* **Ubuntu Certified Hardware:**  For Linux newcomers, Ubuntu reigns supreme as a user-friendly distro. Check the Canonical's Ubuntu certified hardware list here: [https://ubuntu.com/certified](https://ubuntu.com/certified) 
* **Red Hat Hardware Compatibility:**  Some might argue Fedora holds the "King" title, but that's a debate for another day!  Red Hat also offers a hardware compatibility list: [https://catalog.redhat.com/search?searchType=hardware](https://catalog.redhat.com/search?searchType=hardware)
* **OpenSUSE Hardware:**  While a bit technical, OpenSUSE also provides a hardware portal: [https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hardware](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hardware)

**Beyond the Lists: Live Testing and the Open Source Community**

It's important to remember these lists are based on tested hardware.  New components emerge all the time, and you might have a unique setup.   The beauty of Linux is its open-source nature!  You can directly test a distro using a live USB to see if it works on your hardware. 

**Join the Community!**

Remember, open source thrives on community. Encounter compatibility issues? Don't hesitate to reach out to forums and communities for help.  There's a whole world of friendly Linux users waiting to assist!

**So, while I'm back on Windows for now, the door to Linux is definitely not closed.  With a little research and the power of the open-source community, you can create a perfect Linux experience on your next machine!**
