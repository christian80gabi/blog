I've spent the past year using Linux, specifically OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, as my daily driver on my Lenovo IDEAPAD S540 (81ND) laptop. This experience has been both rewarding and challenging, and as I transition back to Windows, I'd like to share my journey and the reasons behind my decision.

## Why I'm Moving Back to Windows?

### Hardware Compatibility
One of the primary reasons for my switch is hardware compatibility. Despite the advances in Linux support, certain components of my laptop just weren't designed with Linux in mind.

1. **WiFi Issues**: My laptop uses an RTL8822BE PCI WiFi card. Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box drivers available for this hardware on Linux. This meant I had to spend considerable time troubleshooting and compiling drivers from source, which was not always successful or stable.
   
2. **Fingerprint Reader**: My fingerprint reader was not supported at all. This might seem like a minor issue, but it was a feature I missed for convenience and security.

### Gaming Performance
Gaming on Linux has come a long way, especially with the advent of tools like Proton and the development of Wayland. However, my experience was less than ideal.

1. **Wayland vs. Xorg**: Due to various issues, I was unable to run Xorg reliably, which led me to use Wayland. While Wayland is a modern display server protocol with many benefits, it is not yet fully optimized for gaming, especially with Nvidia GPUs. I encountered frequent screen tearing and a noticeable drop in performance when running games through Steam's Proton.

## The Positives of My Linux Experience

Despite these challenges, my year with Linux was far from a negative experience. In many ways, it was an eye-opener and a valuable learning journey. Here are some aspects where Linux excelled:

### Privacy
Linux offers a level of privacy that is hard to match on Windows. The open-source nature of the software means there are fewer hidden telemetry and data collection processes running in the background. I always felt more in control of my data on Linux.

### Desktop Environment Choices
Linux provides a plethora of desktop environments to choose from, each offering different features and customization options. Whether it's GNOME, KDE, XFCE, or any other environment, the flexibility to tailor the user interface to my exact preferences was unparalleled. **I use KDE BTW** ðŸ˜Œ

### Customization
The level of customization available on Linux is astounding. From tweaking system settings to modifying the look and feel of the desktop, Linux allows users to create a truly personalized computing environment.

### Free and Open Source Software
Linux's ecosystem is built around free and open-source software (FOSS). This not only makes a wide array of powerful software accessible at no cost but also fosters a community-driven approach to development and support. I discovered many excellent FOSS programs that I continue to use even on Windows.

- **Gimp** (Best Adobe Photoshop alt.)
- **Inskape** (Best Adobe Illustrator alt.)
- **Handbrake** (Best... ugh... you know?!)

### My Coding Experience
My coding experience has never been so expressful. You know?! The feeling of doing something knowing what you're doing, not just doing it 'cause you think it should be done like this. That feeling is... (You know, you know)

## Looking Ahead

My issues with Linux were not because of the operating system itself, but rather due to hardware incompatibilities. This experience has not deterred me from using Linux; in fact, it has solidified my appreciation for it. I plan to continue using Linux on a spare SSD to stay connected with the community and keep honing my troubleshooting skills.

In the future, I aim to purchase a PC specifically designed for Linux to fully leverage the strengths of this remarkable operating system. Until then, I will use Windows as my primary OS while keeping a foot in the Linux world.

## Summary of Challenges

1. **WiFi Troubles**: The lack of out-of-the-box drivers for the RTL8822BE PCI WiFi card made connectivity a constant hassle.
2. **Unsupported Fingerprint Reader**: Missing support for my fingerprint reader was a significant inconvenience.
3. **Nvidia and Xorg Issues**: Kernel panics with Xorg forced me to use Wayland, which, although promising, is not yet fully optimized for gaming with Nvidia GPUs.

In conclusion, my journey with Linux as my daily driver was filled with both highs and lows. While I'm transitioning back to Windows for now, I remain hopeful for a future where my hardware and Linux can work together seamlessly. Until then, my spare SSD will keep me connected to the Linux world, ready to jump back in when the time is right. ðŸ’š
