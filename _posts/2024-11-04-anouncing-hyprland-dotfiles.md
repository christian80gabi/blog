I'm thrilled to share that I've published my latest project, a collection of configuration files for the **Hyprland** Wayland compositor! ðŸŽ‰

**Hyprland** has been a game-changer for those who love the flexibility of the **Wayland** ecosystem, and with these custom configs, users can now enjoy a fully tailored experience right from the start. Whether youâ€™re aiming for aesthetic simplicity or powerful workflows, these configurations have you covered.

ðŸ”§ Key Highlights:
â€” ðŸ”„ Dynamic window management for productivity
â€” ðŸŽ¨ Eye-catching theme & optimized layout
â€” âš¡ Performance-tuned settings for smoother transitions

Perfect for anyone looking to elevate their Linux experience or explore what Hyprland can really do!

Check out the project here [ https://github.com/christian80gabi/hyprland-dotfiles ] and let me know your thoughts. Iâ€™d love feedback from the community. ðŸ˜Š
