Hi Christian here,

I'm an Information Systems Engineer, Full-stack Web Developer and a Graphic Designer. What sparks my eyes are innovations/new technologies. This blog is meant to share my journey experiencing technologies.

My technical expertise includes proficiency in various programming languages, including Java, Java EE, JavaScript, React, Angular, ASP.NET, Python, Django, and Spring Boot. Additionally, I possess a strong understanding of microservices and web services (SOAP, REST), as well as significant experience in data analysis using Talend for Data Integration, Data Warehousing, and ETL. I am also well-versed in cloud computing and committed to ongoing learning and development.

Beyond my technical skills, I am also proficient in graphic design, with experience using tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint & Publisher, Adobe XD, Figma, and Canva.com. While I am constantly striving to improve my abilities in this area, I take pride in my creativity and enjoy producing high-quality graphics and designs.

Thank you for passing by. ðŸ’œ
